# Lagrange Mars Testnet: 1,000,000 LAG Giveaway

Campaign Duration: 14th August, 00:00 (EST) - 10th September, 23:59 (EST)

## Mission 

Lagrange's Mars Testnet is the first attempt to utilize enormous computing and storage resources of Filecoin, Chainlink, BNB Chain, and other blockchains for Web3 developers.

Over the course of four weeks, we will utilize decentralized computing power from different blockchains to create a captivating scene on Planet Mars, including:
- Landscape
- Creatures
- Vehicles, Spaceship
- Buildings and live scene
- CG/Short film

Partners from the realms of AI, gaming, and the metaverse are welcome to join us in this ambitious endeavor by contacting us at tema@filswan.com.


## Goals

- Harness the power of 100 GPUs to generate 1 million images.
- Validate large-scale GPU computing on the Lagrange Network.
- Explore the adaptation of models such as Stable diffusion, Lora, and Dall-E for image generation.
- Solicit developer feedback on space building and datasets.
- Multichain Payment and debug on the payment channel.
- Validate Lagrange Network's new GPU marketplace.
- Collaborate with partners in AI, gaming, and the metaverse.
- Engage our community in the AIGC including images and scenes.
- Attract AI and ML enthusiasts/ experts to the Lagrange Network community.

## Tasks

To be a part of the Lagrange Testnet, interact with Lagrange firsthand, and experience the groundbreaking features and functionalities Lagrange has developed for the future of Web3.

By setting up a Computing Provider, building a Space, or using a Space to create images, you stand a chance to win LAG.
